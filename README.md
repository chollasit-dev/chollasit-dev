# Hi, I'm Chollasit Vibulsirikul! üñ•Ô∏è

Or just call me Chin - a full-stack developer with a multimedia design
background.

## üßë About Me

Before I started my developer adventure, I was a newly graduated student from
multimedia technology aimed to be a UX/UI designer since that's something I
always believed I could do pretty well. Among all things I've learned:
animation, video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling, and game development.

After being inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen)'s
vim-level footwork and how passionate he is about coding, I dove into
development, I started with something seemed not too far from me, PowerShell
scripting (at that time I knew nothing about Linux üòÖ).

I view coding as Lego blocks - arranging them to build amazing things. After my
internship, I began my career as a UI designer who also gets to develop my own
designs and gradually transition to a web developer. One step closer to the
developer I wanna be!

I've discovered my passion for back-end development. I love constructing systems
with multiple components conntected together and seeing how they work to create
a functional whole - like watching the gears of a well-designed machine in
motion.

I love exploring new technologies to make my workflow **_BLAZINGLY FAST_**.

**Fun fact:** Despite my love for Linux tools, I'm still primarily in the
Windows world üòÖ

## üîß Development Environment

I'm passionate about optimizing my development environment:

- Neovim and how **_BLAZINGLY FAST_** I can navigate code! I recently started my
  Neovim journey after using Vim motions in other editors for about a year.

[![NvChad Config](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=chollasit-dev&repo=nvchad-config&theme=dark)](https://github.com/chollasit-dev/nvchad-config)

- My configuration for Neovim in Windows. I rarely use it üòÖ.

[![LazyVim Config](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=chollasit-dev&repo=lazyvim-config&theme=dark)](https://github.com/chollasit-dev/lazyvim-config)

I believe everyone should at least try Vim motions - they're mind-blowing!
